   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/startup-api-user-module.git

2. **Navigate to the project directory**:
    ```bash
    cd startup-api-user-module
    
3. **Install project dependencies** :
    ```bash
    npm install

4. **Set up environment variables**:
    Create a .env file in the root directory and add the following environment variables:
    makefile
    MONGODB_URI=mongodb://your_mongo_connection_string
    PORT=3000

5. **Start the API**:
    ```bash
    npm start
    The API will be running on http://localhost:3000.


## Usage
    Once the API is up and running, you can use tools like Postman or cURL to test the API endpoints. The API allows performing CRUD operations for managing users.
